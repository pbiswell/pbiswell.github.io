title: OpenSwoole HTTP Example
---

This is a project I've been working on, it's a basic, customisable system for page handling with the OpenSwoole HTTP server. I will expand this over time, adding new features and fixing bugs.

You can view the repository here: [here](https://github.com/pbiswell/openswoole-http-example).
