I've been doing web development for 15+ years, working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and more. Since then, I've mostly been focused on SEO, for myself and clients.

I started creating Windows desktop applications 9+ years ago, mainly working with C#, and occasionally VB6.

More recently, I'm coding in Python, giving back to the open source community by building packages which are free to use.

This is just a simple blog for linking to multiple projects.
